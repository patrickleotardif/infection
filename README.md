**Requirements**

No package dependencies. Needs Python 2.7+ (uses dict comprehension)

Tested on 2.7 and shouldn't have any deprecated features in use as far as I know

**Usage**

*command line*  : run `python infection.py` to run a quick test suite

*python module* : 
relevant methods include


- `randomHierarchicalGraph(size, template) ` : using given template (see comments for details) and size, return dict of Users representing a random graph
- `totalInfection(users,seed)` : given dict of Users and a seed, return set of user ids that are infected
- `limitedInfection(users,seed,minUsers,maxUsers)` : same as above, except with given minUsers and maxUsers (picks solutions within threshold where possible)
